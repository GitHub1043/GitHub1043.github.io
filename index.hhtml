<h1 style="font-size:200%;">Cheetah Information</h1>

<h4>Speed</h4>
<p>Fastest mammal on land, the cheetah can reach speeds of 60 or perhaps even 70 <sub>miles</sub> (97 or 113 <sub>kilometers</sub>) an hour over short distances. It usually chases its prey at <em>only about half that speed</em>, however. After a chase, a cheetah needs half an hour to catch its breath before it can eat.</p>

<h4>Hunting</h4>
<p>The cheetah's excellent eyesight helps it find prey during the day. <b>The cheetah is hard to see</b> because its spotted coat blends with the tall, dry grass of the plains. <i>Suddenly, the cheetah makes a lightning dash. It knocks its prey to the ground and then bites its throat.</i> Once found throughout Asia and Africa, cheetahs today are racing toward extinction. Loss of habitat and declining numbers of their prey combine to threaten the future of these cats. <strong>Cheetahs live and hunt mainly in open grasslands and bushy areas in parts of Africa and the Middle East.</strong> <br>Cheetahs eat small- to medium-size animals, such as hares, impalas, wildebeest calves, and gazelles.</p>

<h4>Big Cats</h4>
<p>Because of their size, strength, and predatory skills, cheetahs are considered one of the “big cats.” Tigers, lions, leopards, jaguars, and cougars are also part of this grouping. <br>Take the big cat quiz to see how much you know about these fierce felines. Then, just for fun, see which wild cat you’re most like with our personality quiz.</p>

<h5>"Cheetah"</h5>
<pre>
Lovely spotted yellow beast
Racing through the open feast
Knowing when and where to hunt
Claws are ready, for their final jump

Animals like these, who roam the wild
Nurture their young, like us, our child
They know the truth, about themselves
Living in a jungle of lifetime dwells

They hunt their victims with speed and grace
Showing their agility on this open space
And when their young, have passed the test
Only then, will the cheetah, lay to rest.
<pre>
